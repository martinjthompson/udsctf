# Challenge 00

Read the flag from DID 0x0000.

## Solution framework

The solution needs to instantiate the virtual ECU, and read the appropriate DID.  For example, to read the 
Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) we would read DID 0xF190, which returns a 17-character ASCII string. The UDSONCAN library
does not know how to decode the DIDs as they are different for each ECU on a vehicle, so it provides a configuration which allows you to decode. It does however provide a constant for the VIN DID: `udsoncan.DataIdentifier.VIN`. Something like this can be used to read the VIN:

```
from .. vecu.vecu import Vecu

import udsoncan
from udsoncan.client import Client
from udsoncan.exceptions import NegativeResponseException,InvalidResponseException,UnexpectedResponseException

# create something to decode the VIN string (read up here: https://udsoncan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/udsoncan/helper_classes.html#didcodec)
class VIN_Codec(DidCodec):
    def encode(self, s):
        return bytes(s.encode('ascii'))
    def decode(self, b):
        return b.decode('ascii')
    def __len__(self):
        return 17

# setup a config to tell the Client to use the VIN_Codec for the VIN DID
config = dict(configs.default_client_config)
config['data_identifiers'] = {DataIdentifier.VIN:VIN_Codec}

ecu = Vecu()
with Client(ecu.get_connection(),  request_timeout=2, config=config) as client:
    resp = client.read_data_by_identifier(udsoncan.DataIdentifier.VIN)       
    # the first 2 bytes of the read DID response are always the DID being read (0xF190 in this case), so we skip them
    vin = resp[2:]
    print("Read VIN: %s", vin.data[2:])
ecu.stop()
```            

Now, read the flag from DID 0, (you'll need a [decoder]( https://udsoncan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/udsoncan/helper_classes.html#didcodec) for it... )
